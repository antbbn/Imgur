This is a 100% Bash script used to download imgur albums while making sure that
the order of the pictures is retained. The script now allows for multi-file
support. E.X. ./imgur -m List-Of-Imgur-Album-URLs-seperated-by-newlines.txt

  usage: ./imgur.sh [-cpsm] [file] URL
  This script is used solely to download imgur albums.

  OPTIONS:
    -h        Show this message.
    -m <File> Download multiple albums found in <File>.
    -c        Clean and Remove nonalphanumeric characters from the album's name.
    -p        Preserve imgur's naming. (Warning! This will not retain order.)
    -s        Silent mode.

|USAGE|
+-----+

The script was created so that all that you need to do is copy+paste 
the address bar link into the terminal.

chmod +x imgur.sh
./imgur.sh -h

If you want to use the multiple-files feature then you will need to have
a plain text file with imgur album URLs seperated by new lines
