This is a quick bash script I wrote to download an entire imgur album while keeping the order of the images as they appear on the album and placing them into a nice folder based on the name of the folder. 
I did this by renaming the files themselves so if you still want to reference the original imgur album I would recommend bookmarking it somehow.

Thanks to everyone in this thread who helped me out.

|USAGE|

The script was created so that all that you need to do is copy+paste the address bar link into the terminal.

chmod +x imgur.sh
./imgur.sh https://www.imgur.com/a/XXXXX

|INSTALLATION|

This is only if you want to reference the script without having it in the directory you want the imgur album.

mkdir -p /usr/local/bin 
cd /usr/local/bin
curl -O https://raw.github.com/manabutameni/Imgur/master/imgur.sh
mv imgur.sh imgur
chmod +x imgur
PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin # only if you haven't done this already
export PATH

To use:
imgur https://www.imgur.com/a/XXXXX
