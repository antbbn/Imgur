This is a 100% Bash script used to download imgur albums while making sure that
the order of the pictures is retained. The script now allows for multi-file
support.

  usage: ./imgur.sh [-cpsm] [file] URL
  This script is used solely to download imgur albums.

  OPTIONS:
    -h        Show this message.
    -m <File> Download multiple albums found in <File>.
    -c        Clean and Remove nonalphanumeric characters from the album's name.
    -p        Preserve imgur's naming. (Warning! This will not retain order.)
    -s        Silent mode.

Thanks to everyone in this thread who helped me out.

|USAGE|
+-----+

The script was created so that all that you need to do is copy+paste 
the address bar link into the terminal.

chmod +x imgur.sh
./imgur.sh -h

If you want to use the multiple-files feature then you will need to have
a plain text file with imgur album URLs seperated by new lines

./imgur.sh -m Imgur-Albums-List.txt

|INSTALLATION|
+------------+

This is only if you want to reference the script without having it in 
the directory you want the imgur album.

sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin 
sudo chown `whoami` /usr/local/bin
cd /usr/local/bin
curl https://raw.github.com/manabutameni/Imgur/master/imgur.sh -o imgur
chmod +x imgur
PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin # only if you haven't done this already
export PATH

To use:
imgur http://www.imgur.com/a/XXXXX

+--------------+
|FOR KDE4 USERS|
+--------------+

There is a file named imgur.desktop with you in mind.
Simply copy to your local `kde4-config --path services` location.
